          <p>
            I declare that I am not suffering from any health condition, and I am physically and psychologically well prepared to participate in this run. I do not have any cardiorespiratory disease, physical defect, or injury, which would discourage my participation. I am participating voluntarily and under my own responsibility. Consequently, I exonerate the organizers, collaborators, sponsors, and any other participants of any liabilities for any physical or material damage that occurs to me during the event.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Personal data is collected exclusively for event registration and communication. Information will not be shared or used for other purposes without the participantâ€™s explicit consent.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. Liability Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            Participants agree that the event platform is not liable for any injury, loss, or damage during the event. By joining, participants waive claims against the platform and its affiliates.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">4. Organizer Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            The platform only provides registration and promotion support. Event planning, execution, and safety are the sole responsibility of the event organizer.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">5. Event Changes or Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            The platform may change event details or cancel listings if needed. It is not responsible for participant-incurred costs, such as travel or lodging.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">6. Insurance Liability</h3>
          <p>
            SAP is organizing the event/run solely in the capacity of a facilitator. SAP shall not be held liable for procuring or maintaining any form of insurance coverage on behalf of any participant or runner. Each participant is individually responsible for securing their own insurance, whether health, accident, or liability, as deemed necessary for their participation in the event.
            <br /><br />
            By choosing to participate in the event/run, all participants expressly waive any and all claims against SAP, its employees, partners, and the general public for any injury, accident, loss, or damage that may arise during the course of the event.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, participant(s) acknowledge that they are physically fit and capable of participating in the event and voluntarily assume full responsibility for any risks associated with their participation.
          </p>
