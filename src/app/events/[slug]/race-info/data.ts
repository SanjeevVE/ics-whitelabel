      "Hello! I'm Deepak Ram. I’ll be pacing the 50-minute bus for the upcoming 10K and look forward to helping you hit your goal! We’ll follow a steady pacing strategy, aiming to maintain even effort throughout the race while adjusting slightly for uphill or downhill stretches. This approach helps conserve energy and keeps you feeling strong all the way to the finish.\n\nI’ve run 9 full marathons and numerous shorter races, so I understand how pacing and mindset play a big role. My personal best for the 10K is 42:56, but on race day, I’ll be focused entirely on helping *you* finish in 50 minutes. Stick with me, trust the pace, and let’s cross that line together!",

My PB for 10K is 48 minutes and I will lead the 55-minute bus for the SAP Run 2025.\n\nWe'll follow a three-phase strategy:\n- **Phase 1**: Fast Start – Begin strong to build a cushion.\n- **Phase 2**: Steady Middle – Lock into a manageable pace.\n- **Phase 3**: Strong Finish – Controlled end with confidence.\n\nLet’s run as a team, feed off each other’s energy, and finish strong!",
