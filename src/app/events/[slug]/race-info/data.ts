    about: `Hello! I'm Deepak Ram. I’ll be pacing the 50-minute bus for the upcoming 10K and look forward to helping you hit your goal! We’ll be following a steady pacing strategy, aiming to maintain an even effort throughout the race while adjusting slightly for uphill or downhill stretches. This approach helps conserve energy and keeps you feeling strong all the way to the finish.

I’ve run 9 full marathons and numerous shorter-distance races, so I understand how pacing and mindset play a big role in getting the best out of your run. My personal best for the 10K is 42:56, but on race day, I’ll be focused entirely on helping *you* get to the finish in 50 minutes, with a strong and controlled effort.

Stick with me, trust the pace, and let’s cross that line together right on target. I’ll be there to motivate, monitor, and keep the rhythm. Let’s do this!`,

    about: `Hi, my name is Binod Negi and I’m thrilled to be your pacer for the SAP 10K! With over 12 years of running and coaching—from my first 10K to now training for ultras—I’ve learned that running is a victory of mind and body. My PB for 10K is 48 mins and I will lead the 55 min bus for the SAP Run 2025.

All your hard training has prepared you for this moment. To ensure we achieve our goal, we're going to adopt a strategic three-phase approach:

• Phase 1: The Fast Start  
We'll try and leverage the energy at the start line, beginning at a faster clip for the first few KMs. This allows us to use our initial adrenaline wisely and build a small time cushion.

• Phase 2: The Steady Middle  
Once the race settles, so will we. We'll lock into a consistent, manageable pace for the core of the race, focusing on our rhythm and conserving energy on any inclines.

• Phase 3: The Strong Finish  
Thanks to our fast start, we won't need a frantic final sprint. Instead, we can approach the finish line with a controlled and relaxed pace, feeling strong and confident as we cross well under our 55-minute goal.

You can see the exact pace for each KM in the detailed chart below.

Let’s run as a team, feed off each other's energy, and remain mentally tough. Trust your training, trust our plan, and let’s cross that finish line together! Let's do this!`,

I'm Gokul, and I'll be pacing the 90-minute bus for the SAP Run 2025. I’m an ultra runner with experience in several ultra marathons, including a 100 km run, over 20 full marathons, and numerous half marathons and 10K runs. My official personal best for a 10K is 43:02 minutes.

The 90-minute bus aims to maintain optimal speeds during both uphills and downhills, ensuring that runners don’t get exhausted. We will stop at refuel stations along the way for nutrition, recovery, and rest.

This is the last pacing bus for the SAP Run 2025, so feel free to join if you’re aiming to finish the run in around 90 minutes.

Our primary goal is not just to finish the event on time, but also to provide you with an amazing running experience. Cheers!`,
